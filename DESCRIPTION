Description: IMatlas is a public web application and library of R functions to infer immune processes associated with specific metabolites and vice versa. 
The IMA derives metabolite-immune process associations utilizing a protein-metabolite network analysis algorithm that associates 
immune system-associated annotated proteins in Gene Ontology to metabolites.
